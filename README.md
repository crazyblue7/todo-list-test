# this project is no longer in development
i have stopped the development of this project actually quite a long time ago but then i forgot about its existence and so
its essencially dead.
# todo-list-test
Just a simple todo list made with .net and WinForms <br>
Use the source-code however you want, i dont care about it

# note
the installer does NOT add a startmenu entry, you need to add the entry MANUALLY
